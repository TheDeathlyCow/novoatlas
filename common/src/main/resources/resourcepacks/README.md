# NovoAtlas Example Datapacks

These datapacks demonstrate a few basic configurations for a NovoAtlas datapack, using the Avila mountains. Full instructions on how to configure NovoAtlas can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/novoatlas/wiki/).

You can get these datapacks from the [releases page](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/novoatlas/releases). These datapacks are also builtin with the mod, and you can enable them in the World Creation menu (Singleplayer > Create New World > More > Datapacks). After the world is created, they will be available in that world's `datapacks` folder.

> [!NOTE]
> All of the datapacks use the custom dimension `avila-example:avila` for the world. To go to this dimension once you've created a world, enable cheats and use the command `/execute in avila-example:avila run tp @s ~ ~ ~` teleport there!
