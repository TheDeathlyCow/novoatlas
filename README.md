# NovoAtlas

A data-driven image based world generator for Minecraft. Based on [Atlas](https://www.github.com/itsmiir/atlas/) by itsmiir.

## Installation 

NovoAtlas will eventually be able to be installed from CurseForge and Modrinth.

## How to Use

The [repository wiki](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/novoatlas/wiki) describes how to use this mod to create your own worlds/dimensions.

Example datapacks are builtin with the mod, but can also be downloaded separately from the [releases page](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/novoatlas/releases).

## Build Instructions

NovoAtlas is built using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) with the [Architectury Loom](https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom) plugin. You can build your own copy of NovoAtlas by running the command:

```bash
./gradlew build
```
