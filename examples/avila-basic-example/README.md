# Avila Basic Example Pack

This is an example datapack for NovoAtlas based on the Avila mountains.

This pack is specially licensed under [CC0](./LICENSE). You may adapt and modify this pack for your own use with the need for attribution.

To use this pack, you can simply replace the [height map](./data/avila-example/novoatlas/heightmap) and [biome maps](./data/avila-example/novoatlas/biome_map) with your own images. Be sure that all of these images have the same dimensions! For best results, the width and height of images should be some whole-number multiple of 16 (to align with chunk boundaries). However, this is not strictly necessary
